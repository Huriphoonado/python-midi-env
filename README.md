# Python MIDI Environment
This project is still in progress!

In order to use, open up the Max patch and then run from the terminal ```$ python3 playMaxNotes.py```. A standalone test/example file will likely be added soon.

You will need to add the dependency [python-osc](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-osc) which you can install via the command ```$ pip install python-osc```.

If you have Max 6 or Max 7, simply open up the Max patch. Otherwise, download and use [Max Runtime](https://cycling74.com/downloads/older/#.VvhnEWMh6vk). We may include a standalone version of the patch to prevent this step.
